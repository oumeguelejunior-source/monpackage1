\title{Diagnostic Plots for Laplace Measurement Error Models}
\usage{
\method{plot}{laplace_measure}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"laplace_measure"}.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Produces diagnostic plots for a fitted Laplace measurement error model.
}
\details{
The following plots are displayed:
\enumerate{
  \item Histogram of the errors with the fitted Laplace density.
  \item Normal Q--Q plot of residuals against theoretical Laplace quantiles.
  \item Errors plotted against observation index.
  \item Empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) with fitted
  Laplace cumulative distribution function.
}

These plots are intended to assess the adequacy of the Laplace model
and to identify potential deviations such as outliers or model misspecification.
